# Tic Tac Toe - Frontend Recruitment

Objective: Enhance and refactor the Tic Tac Toe game with a focus on production-readiness. Candidates are invited to implement features and best practices suitable for a robust, deployable application. Feel free to refactor as you wish and also improve the UI's efficiency and aesthetic.

## To Do:

- [ ] Add quick documentation to enable starting the project locally.
- [ ] Implement logic to revert to a previous state of the game when clicking on a history item.
- [ ] Draft a specification and implementation plan for the dual drive installation (as if it were a Jira ticket), including technology choices and necessary points of attention.
